v0.0.1 to v0.0.8: look in the commits, I wrote the changes there. maybe I'll add them here later

v0.0.9
  Added
    - Changelog (English only)
    - Option to toggle if you want the changelog to be shown on update
    - Displays animated user avatars in user information
  Changes
    - Position and size of the four panels, now based on percentage and pixels, not only percentage -> not fcked up with weird width/height ratios
    - Improved welcome message (thank you @Daddy#0001)

v0.1.0
  Added
    - Link to the GitHub page with all changes in the changelog
  Changes
    - Versions are now displayed as "v0.1.0" instead of "0.1.0" in the changelog

v0.1.1
  Added
    - Highlighting of the current version in the changelog
    - More German translations
    - If you click on how many friends/blocked users there are in a guild, you get a list of them. If you click one of them, they're shown in the user information
  Changes
    - Slightly increased the delay for adding the menu item when clicking on the guild name above the channel list, so it should always work
    - The activity field now has a margin of 25px (bottom), so the 'Open Chat' button isn't covering it anymore

v1.0.0
  Added
    - The static content of the changelog (title, the notice where to find all changes) is now translatable
    - Showing guild icon
    - Showing acronym of guilds
    - The buttons 'Open Chat' and 'Connect' in the channel info have a function now
  Changes
    - Version number and category title in the changelog are now bold
    - Changelog title (last and current version) is now bold and centered
    - I think this plugin is completed now. Of course I won't stop improving it, but in the current state you can call it finished. I still have some ideas what to add, but not that many as I had at the beginning. That is why I made this jump from version 0.1.1 to 1.0.0. I think there may be less updates from now.
  Planned
    - Button in the settings to show the changelog
    - Option to change the language manually in the settings
