v0.0.1 to v0.0.8: look in the commits, I wrote the changes there. maybe I'll add them here later

v0.0.9
  Added
    - Changelog (English only)
    - Option to toggle if you want the changelog to be shown on update
    - Displays animated user avatars in user information
  Changes
    - Position and size of the four panels, now based on percentage and pixels, not only percentage -> not fcked up with weird width/height ratios
    - Improved welcome message (thank you @Daddy#0001)

v0.1.0
  Added
    - Link to the GitHub page with all changes in the changelog
  Changes
    - Versions are now displayed as "v0.1.0" instead of "0.1.0" in the changelog

v0.1.1
  Added
    - Highlighting of the current version in the changelog
    - More German translations
    - If you click on how many friends/blocked users there are in a guild, you get a list of them. If you click one of them, they're shown in the user information
  Changes
    - Slightly increased the delay for adding the menu item when clicking on the guild name above the channel list, so it should always work
    - The activity field now has a margin of 25px (bottom), so the 'Open Chat' button isn't covering it anymore

v1.0.0
  Added
    - The static content of the changelog (title, the notice where to find all changes) is now translatable
    - Showing guild icon
    - Showing acronym of guilds
    - The buttons 'Open Chat' and 'Connect' in the channel info have a function now
  Changes
    - Version number and category title in the changelog are now bold
    - Changelog title (last and current version) is now bold and centered
    - I think this plugin is completed now. Of course I won't stop improving it, but in the current state you can call it finished. I still have some ideas what to add, but not that many as I had at the beginning. That is why I made this jump from version 0.1.1 to 1.0.0. I think there may be less updates from now.
  Planned
    - Button in the settings to show the changelog
    - Option to change the language manually in the settings

    - Option to select the language of the plugin
    - More click events to copy the shown text (not finished yet)

    - Option to stop loading the information on guild change
  Fixed
    - Channel/role/member count is now visible in the guild info again
    - Fixed the position of the search result in user information in English language
    - Fixed the 'Copy' button in role information. It got created every time the popup opened but never got deleted

  Changes
    - Removed some comments in the code that were from the first prototype of this plugin or some functions

v1.1.3
  Changed
    - Categories are not counted in the channel count anymore
  Fixed
    - If the owner isn't loaded when you click on "Show Guild Data" the plugin tries again until it is loaded. So you don't have to click the button twice. But the content of the old guild is visible in that time.
